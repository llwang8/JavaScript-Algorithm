//Eight Queens

/*
This week's Coding for Interviews question is the Eight Queens Puzzle,
where the challenge is to find all the ways to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chess board,
such that none of them are in a position to kill each other in the next move. You can
see how tricky this can be if you try to do it by hand (unless you're Emilie, who
found a solution in just a few minutes).
